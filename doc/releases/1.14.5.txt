Scrapbook X 1.14.5
==================

Changes since v1.14.4
---------------------

 * Fixed and reworked search query processing:

   * Fixed an issue that escaping a double quote by doubling it in a
     quoted search term of a search command does not work.

   * Fixed an issue that a non-quoted term is not separated at a 
     space-like char (e.g. tab).

   * The term of command "type:" is now used as the key for full text
     matching if and only if RegExp mode is off.

   * The term of command "mc:" or "re:" is now ignored.

 * Decreased the indentation of the index page generated by "Output
   HTML tree".

Also includes some localization improvements.
